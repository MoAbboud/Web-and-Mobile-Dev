Welcome to my ICP1 repository!

This repository is the first week assignment for the web and mobile development course currently taken at UMKC!

In this repository I will demonstrate the main points that were taken to complete the assignment. There will also be a wiki page in which there will be a more detailed explanation with steps.

1. This repository contains 2 folders and a ReadMe file plus a test file which was created after creating the repository.
    
    i- Documentation Folder: The folder that contains all the screenshots and videos made to document the repository.
    ii- Source Folder: The folder that contains all the source code.
    iii- ReadMe.txt: A general overview about what is found in the repository.
