Welcome to my ICP1 repository!

This ICP is a basic tutorial on how GitHub basic function work. It was created by Mohamad Abboud for the Web and Mobile Programming course.

This repository is the first week assignment for the web and mobile development course currently taken at UMKC!

In this repository I will demonstrate the main points that were taken to complete the assignment.

Head over to the wiki page in which there will be a more detailed explanation with steps and screenshots for each step.

    i- Documentation Folder: The folder that contains all the screenshots and videos made to document the repository.
    ii- Source Folder: The folder that contains all the source code.
